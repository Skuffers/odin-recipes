    <p>Yummy appetizer with a kick great for parties or just a nice snack.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>cooking spray</li>
            <li>12 whole fresh mushrooms, tough ends trimmed</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon minced garlic</li>
            <li>1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened</li>
            <li>¼ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon onion powder</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
        </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Prepare a baking sheet with cooking spray.</li>
            <li>Clean mushrooms with a damp paper towel. Carefully break stems from mushrooms. Finely chop stems and set caps aside.</li>
            <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Fry chopped mushroom stems and garlic in hot oil until any moisture has disappeared, taking care not to burn the garlic, 3 to 5 minutes. Spread mushroom mixture into a bowl to cool completely, about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Stir cream cheese, Parmesan cheese, black pepper, onion powder, and cayenne pepper into the cooled mushroom mixture until very thick and completely mixed. Use a small spoon to fill each mushroom cap with a generous amount of stuffing. Arrange stuffed mushrooms on the prepared cookie sheet.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until piping hot and liquid starts to form under each cap, about 20 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
