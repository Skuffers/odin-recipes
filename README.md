# Favorite-Recipes
Silly little website containing some of my favorite dishes and their recipes.

First project putting in to practice setting up boilerplate html, using relative links, creating lists, using the image element and making frequent and good commit messages.

I welcome any comments and criticism. I want to improve in any way I can!
